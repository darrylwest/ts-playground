# Gemini Session Summary

This document summarizes the changes made during the Gemini CLI session.

## Implemented Features:

- **TypeScript Compilation to `dist` folder:**
    - Modified `tsconfig.json` in `packages/client` and `packages/server` to output compiled JavaScript to a `dist` directory.
    - Added `dist` to the `.gitignore` files in `packages/client` and `packages/server` to prevent compiled files from being committed.
    - Added `build` scripts to `packages/client/package.json` and `packages/server/package.json` to run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`).

## Resolved Issues:

- **`npm install` JSON parsing error:**
    - Encountered persistent `EJSONPARSE` errors during `npm install` due to a subtle issue in the root `package.json` file.
    - Attempted various fixes including rewriting the file, clearing `npm` cache, and updating `npm`.
    - The issue was eventually resolved by manually correcting the `package.json` syntax in `packages/client` (missing comma after `scripts` block) and re-running `npm install`.
    - The root `package.json` was also re-initialized and the `workspaces` entry was re-added.
